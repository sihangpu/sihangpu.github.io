I am currently a [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en) postdoctoral researcher at [Research Institute on the Foundations of Computer Science (IRIF)](https://www.irif.fr), France, hosted by [Geoffroy Couteau](https://geoffroycouteau.github.io).
I am interested in both theoretical and applied cryptographic problems, such as secure computations and post-quantum signatures.


### Bio
Before joining [IRIF](https://www.irif.fr), I was a PhD student working in [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/), Germany, supervised by [Nico DÃ¶ttling](https://sites.google.com/site/nicodoettling/).
Prior to that, I was a software engineer working on graphics rendering at [Autodesk Inc](https://autodesk.com/).
I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Dawu Gu](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=169) and [Yu Yu](http://yuyu.hk).
