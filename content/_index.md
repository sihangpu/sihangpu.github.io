I will be joining [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/) starting next semester. My research interests span a broad range of cryptographic areas, including foundational theory, multi-party computation, public-key encryption, and lattice-based constructions.

I was a [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en) postdoctoral researcher at [Institut de Recherche en Informatique Fondamentale (IRIF)](https://www.irif.fr), France, hosted by [Geoffroy Couteau](https://geoffroycouteau.github.io).
Prior to that, I was a PhD student working at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/), Germany, supervised by [Nico Döttling](https://sites.google.com/site/nicodoettling/).

I am actively involved in academic service, particularly as a reviewer for submissions to many leading cryptography and security conferences & journals, including Crypto, Eurocrypt, Asiacrypt, ICALP, TCC, PKC, CCS, S&P, ACNS, ESORICS, TIFS, and others.

**Program Committee:** Eurocrypt 2026; USENIX Security 2026; CCS 2025,2026; CiC 2025.
