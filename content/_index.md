### About Me

I am a PhD candidate at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/), fortunately, having [Nico Döttling](https://sites.google.com/site/nicodoettling/) as my supervisor.
I am interested in both theoretical and applied cryptography problems, such as post-quantum cryptography, two-party computation, and privacy enhanced techniques.


### Short Bio
Before joining CISPA, I worked as a software engineer in [Autodesk Inc.](https://autodesk.com/) on graphics rendering after graduating from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) with Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology, where I was supervised by [Dawu Gu](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=169) and [Yu Yu](http://yuyu.hk). 


### Other Experience
 - visited Simons Institute, University of California, Berkeley, in spring 2020, to attend a [research program about lattices](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/lattices2020)
 - visited The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Isreal, in 2019, to attend a [winter school about quantum computing](https://iias.huji.ac.il/SchoolCSE4)
