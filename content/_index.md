I will be joining [East China Normal University](https://english.ecnu.edu.cn/) this spring. 
My research interests include cryptographic foundations, multi-party computation (with a particular focus on 2PC), public-key encryption, and lattice-based constructions.

I was a [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en) postdoctoral researcher at the [Research Institute on the Foundations of Computer Science (IRIF)](https://www.irif.fr) in France, hosted by [Geoffroy Couteau](https://geoffroycouteau.github.io).
Prior to that, I completed my PhD at the [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/) in Germany under the supervision of [Nico Döttling](https://sites.google.com/site/nicodoettling/), and received my Master's degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

I have been a Program Committee member for Eurocrypt 2026, USENIX Security 2026, CCS 2025/2026, and CiC 2025.
