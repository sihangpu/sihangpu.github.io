I am currently a [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en) postdoctoral researcher at [Research Institute on the Foundations of Computer Science (IRIF)](https://www.irif.fr), Paris, hosted by [Geoffroy Couteau](https://geoffroycouteau.github.io).
I am interested in both theoretical and applied cryptographic problems, such as two-party secure computations, post-quantum signatures, and privacy-related protocols.


### Short Bio
Before joining [IRIF](https://www.irif.fr), I worked in [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/), Germany, as a PhD student and was supervised by [Nico DÃ¶ttling](https://sites.google.com/site/nicodoettling/).
Prior to that, I worked as a software engineer in [Autodesk Inc.](https://autodesk.com/) on graphics rendering.
I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Dawu Gu](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=169) and [Yu Yu](http://yuyu.hk). 


### Other Experience
 - visited the Simons Institute, University of California, Berkeley, in spring 2020, to attend a [research program about lattices](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/lattices2020)
 - visited the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Isreal, in 2019, to attend a [winter school about quantum computing](https://iias.huji.ac.il/SchoolCSE4)
 - visited the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2017, to attend a summer school
